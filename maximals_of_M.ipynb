We claim that for types G and B, $g_5$ should have fixed-point space of dimension $4$; and that for type T, $g_5$ should have trivial fixed-point space. This corresponds to $g_5$ having $\\chi_{24}$-value $-1$ for types G and T, and $-6$ for type B. The following code checks that this is indeed the case. Note that mmgroup calculates $\\chi_{24}$ only up to sign, so the calculated character values are actually $1$ and $6$. Also recall that $g_5 \\in \\mathbf{G}$ only in \"type G\"; in the other two cases, we must first conjugate $g_5$ into $\\mathbf{G}$ via the element \"$h$\" defined above."
